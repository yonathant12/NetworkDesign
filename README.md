<h1>Network Design</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
For this project, I designed a small enterprise network infrastructure for a company with five locations. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, I configured and implemented various essential network features, including OSPF, DHCP, VoIP, IPv6, NAT, and Access Control Lists. The design involved allocating IP addresses to multiple network devices across the sites, ensuring seamless connectivity and security.
